# Guide to Bayesian Inference: Analytical Approach vs MCMC with PyMC

This document serves as a complementary guide to the `bayesian_inference_comparison.ipynb` notebook, providing additional explanations about theoretical concepts, implementation, and results.

## Introduction to Bayesian Inference

Bayesian inference is a statistical approach that allows us to update our beliefs about unknown parameters as we obtain new data. It is based on Bayes' theorem, which provides a mathematical framework for combining prior information (prior distribution) with new evidence (likelihood) to reach updated conclusions (posterior distribution).

## Theoretical Foundations

### Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem is expressed as:

$$P(\theta|x) = \frac{P(x|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(x)}$$

Where:
- $P(\theta|x)$ is the posterior distribution (what we want to calculate)
- $P(x|\theta)$ is the likelihood (how probable the data is given the parameter)
- $P(\theta)$ is the prior distribution (our initial beliefs)
- $P(x)$ is the evidence (a normalization factor)

### Conjugate Distributions

A prior distribution is said to be conjugate to a likelihood if the resulting posterior distribution belongs to the same family as the prior distribution. Some common examples include:

- Beta-Binomial: For estimating proportions
- Gamma-Poisson: For estimating rates
- Normal-Normal: For estimating means with known variance

Conjugate distributions allow for exact analytical solutions, which greatly simplifies calculations.

## Approaches to Bayesian Inference

### Analytical Approach

The analytical approach uses mathematics to derive closed-form expressions for the posterior distribution. This is possible when:

1. Conjugate distributions are used
2. The model is relatively simple
3. The number of parameters is small

**Advantages:**
- Exact solutions
- Computationally efficient
- No convergence diagnostics required

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited applicability to certain models
- Difficult to extend to complex problems
- May require complicated mathematical manipulations

### MCMC Approach

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are numerical techniques that generate samples from the posterior distribution. These methods are especially useful when:

1. No conjugate distributions exist
2. The model is complex
3. There are many parameters
4. The posterior distribution is high-dimensional

**Advantages:**
- Applicable to almost any Bayesian model
- Can handle complex models
- Provides direct samples from the posterior distribution
- Facilitates calculation of any posterior statistic

**Disadvantages:**
- Stochastic approximation (not exact)
- Computationally intensive
- Requires convergence diagnostics
- May suffer from mixing problems in complex models

## Implementation in Python

### Analytical Approach

To implement analytical solutions in Python, we typically use probability distribution functions from libraries like `scipy.stats`. For example, for the Beta-Binomial case:

```python
from scipy import stats

# Prior parameters
alpha_prior = 1
beta_prior = 1

# Observed data
n_trials = 50
n_success = 35

# Posterior parameters
alpha_posterior = alpha_prior + n_success
beta_posterior = beta_prior + n_trials - n_success

# Posterior distribution
posterior = stats.beta(alpha_posterior, beta_posterior)

# Statistics of interest
posterior_mean = posterior.mean()
posterior_var = posterior.var()
credible_interval = posterior.interval(0.95)
```

### MCMC Approach with PyMC

PyMC is a Python library that facilitates the implementation of Bayesian models using MCMC. For the same Beta-Binomial example:

```python
import pymc as pm
import arviz as az

# Define the model
with pm.Model() as model:
    # Prior
    theta = pm.Beta('theta', alpha=1, beta=1)
    
    # Likelihood
    y = pm.Binomial('y', n=50, p=theta, observed=35)
    
    # Sampling
    trace = pm.sample(2000, tune=1000, return_inferencedata=True)

# Results analysis
summary = az.summary(trace)
posterior_mean = summary.loc['theta', 'mean']
posterior_sd = summary.loc['theta', 'sd']
hdi = az.hdi(trace, var_names=['theta'])
```

## Interpreting Results

### Posterior Distribution

The posterior distribution represents our updated belief about the parameters after observing the data. From it, we can extract:

- **Posterior mean**: Point estimate of the parameter
- **Posterior mode**: Most probable value of the parameter
- **Posterior standard deviation**: Uncertainty about the parameter
- **Credible interval**: Range that contains the parameter with a certain probability

### MCMC Diagnostics

When using MCMC methods, it's important to verify the convergence and quality of the samples through:

- **Traces**: Visualization of the chains to detect mixing problems
- **Autocorrelation**: Measures the dependence between consecutive samples
- **R-hat**: Statistic that measures convergence between multiple chains
- **Effective sample size**: Estimates how many equivalent independent samples we have

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Proportion Estimation (Beta-Binomial)

This is the simplest example and is used to estimate the probability of success in a binomial process, such as the probability of a coin landing heads.

### Example 2: Bayesian Linear Regression

Bayesian linear regression extends the classical regression model by incorporating uncertainty about the parameters. It allows:

- Incorporating prior knowledge about the coefficients
- Quantifying uncertainty in predictions
- Naturally handling overfitting problems

## Conclusions and Recommendations

- **For simple problems with conjugate distributions**: The analytical approach is preferable for its accuracy and efficiency.
- **For complex models or without conjugacy**: MCMC methods are the most practical option.
- **For exploratory analysis**: PyMC provides an intuitive interface and valuable diagnostic tools.
- **For production**: Consider optimized implementations or variational approximations for very large models.
